Coffee Machine Program (Python)
📌 Overview

This is a Python console-based Coffee Machine simulation.
The program allows users to order drinks, process coin payments, check available resources, and manage profits just like a real coffee machine.

☕ Available Drinks

The machine can prepare the following beverages:

Espresso – $1.50

Latte – $2.50

Cappuccino – $3.00

Each drink requires specific amounts of water, milk, and coffee.

⚙️ How the Program Works

The user selects a drink (espresso, latte, or cappuccino).

The machine checks if enough resources are available.

The user inserts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).

If payment is sufficient:

Change is returned (if any).

Resources are deducted.

The drink is served.

If resources or money are insufficient, the transaction is canceled.
